# JavaScript Multiply & Divide Exercise

This is a simple JavaScript exercise that demonstrates how to create a program to calculate multiplication and division of two numbers entered by the user. The program consists of an HTML form with input fields for two numbers, buttons to trigger either multiplication or division, and a section to display the result.

## Instructions

1. Enter two numbers in the input fields provided.
2. Click on either the "Multiply" or "Divide" button to perform the respective operation.
